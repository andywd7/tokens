## Accessibility

Buttons are interactive controls and thus focusable. If the button role is added to an element that is not focusable by itself (such as `<span>`, `<div>` or `<p>`) then, the tabindex attribute has to be used to make the button focusable.

Warning: Be careful when marking up links with the button role. Buttons are expected to be triggered using the Space or Enter key, while links are expected to be triggered using the Enter key. In other words, when links are used to behave like buttons, adding role="button" alone is not sufficient. It will also be necessary to add a key event handler that listens for the Space key in order to be consistent with native buttons.

When the button role is used, screen readers announce the element as a button, generally saying "click" followed by the button's accessible name. The accessible name is either the content of the element or the value of an aria-label or element referenced by an aria-labelledby attribute, or description, if included.
